# dwr_922py
D-Link DWR-922 with SSID Vivo-Internet-HHHH from Anatel Keygen

Much thanks to Selenium on hashkiller forums for implementing the commander binary into an emulator\
Without it would not have been possible to debug this and extract the keygen\
This is mode 4 and 12 from the lte3301 /usr/sbin/commander binary\
Used on at least the D-Link DWR-922 with SSID Vivo-Internet-HHHH from Anatel

Usage: python3 dwr_922.py f8e903a05966
